The extract refers to the position of the body, in particular the form adopted by a body during an action or a specific movement [see : Hdt, VI, 129 ](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0016.tlg001.perseus-eng1:6.129.1); [Eur. Cyc. 221](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0006.tlg001.perseus-eng1:82-130); [Iph.Taur.291-292](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0006.tlg013.perseus-eng1:260-294); [Plato, Cratylus, 423 a](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0059.tlg005.perseus-eng1:423a);[ Critias, 110b ](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0059.tlg032.perseus-eng1:110b); [Leg. II, 655a-b](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0059.tlg034.perseus-eng1:2.655a). 

Here, it seems that Xenophon was the first to use the word σχῆμα in connection with the arts. He uses the same word for sculpture: [Mem. III. 10. 6-8 ](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg002.perseus-eng1:3.10.6). In this case, the word can refer to the preparatory work of the painters, namely the outline drawing. We know from Pliny that Parrhasius was well-known for his talent at drawing. [Plin. XXXV. 67-68](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-lat1:35.66); [Paus. I, 28.2](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-eng1:1.28.2). The statement from Pliny is controversial and must be discussed further. However, the mastery of outline drawing is well-known for ancient painting, not only for wall painting but vase-painting also provides many examples. Xenophon is perfectly aware of the effect that can be obtained with only a few lines.  This dialogue shows a pretty good knowledge about the arts of the time: the theory, but also the techniques used by artists like shadowing, foreshortening, etc... Two examples: the [rapt of Persephone](#img-vergina-rapt). We can see the preparatory drawing on the wall and the rendering of the volumes with the use of little creases. 

The same applies to vase-painting: the rendering of volumes, textures etc, are due to the drawing. An example from red-figure vase-painting: [an amphora signed by Euthymides son of Polias](#img-euthymides) (perhaps the sculptor known by an inscription on the Acropolis: IG I³, 661, 727, 659, 657, 663a; Raubitschek, A.E., Dedications from the Athenian Acropolis: a catalogue of the inscriptions of the 6th and 5th centuries B.C., Cambridge, 1949, 189-190, 220). End of the 6th Century B.C. (Munich, Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2307). We must pay attention to the poses of the three komastes. The one in the middle is particularly interesting: he has a twisting pose rendered by one line drawn from his neck to his coccyx.  This line links the frontal view of the torso to the side of the legs, giving us a harmonious and dynamic view of this dancing man. This kind of example shows the ability of ancient painters at drawing. With only a few lines, they could represent many features, such as movement or volume.
